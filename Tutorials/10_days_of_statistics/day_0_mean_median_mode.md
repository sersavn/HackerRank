### Task
Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines.
If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.

Note: Other than the modal value (which will always be an integer), your answers should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3, 7.0 format).

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer, N , denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the array's elements.

### Constraints
10 =< N =< 2500
0 < $$x_{i} =< 10^{5}$$, where $$x_{i}$$ is the i-th element of the array.

### Output Format
Print  lines of output in the following order:
Print the mean on a new line, to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 ,7.0).
Print the median on a new line, to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 ,7.0).
Print the mode on a new line;
if more than one such value exists, print the numerically smallest one.
