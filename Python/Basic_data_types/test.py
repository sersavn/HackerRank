#You are given three integers X Y and Z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer N.
#You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to N. Here,
#0<= i <= X; 0<= j <= Y; 0<= k <= Z;

#without list comrehensions:
x = 2
